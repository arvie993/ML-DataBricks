Machine Learning Exercises using Databricks


Some of my machine learning exercises using distributed computing(Pyspark)


## Data Exploration Lab
The main purpose of the lab is to clean the Airbnb data and perform some EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and establish a baseline model. In Databricks one of the main advantages from an EDA is that there are built in visualization tools which make the process more simple and intuitive.
